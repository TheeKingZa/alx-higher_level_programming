# What’s an interactive test?
	An interactive test is a form of testing where the tester actively engages with the software, providing input and observing the output in real-time. This can be particularly useful for exploring and validating specific functionalities, especially in interactive applications or when dealing with complex user interactions.

	To conduct interactive tests, ensure that your program or module is designed to receive input interactively, and you can observe the output dynamically.

# Why tests are important?
	Testing is crucial for the development process for several reasons:

	Identifying Bugs: Tests help catch bugs and errors early in the development process, preventing them from reaching the production environment.

	Ensuring Correct Functionality: Tests ensure that each component of your codebase functions as intended, contributing to the overall reliability of your software.

	Facilitating Code Maintenance: Tests act as a safety net, allowing developers to make changes confidently, knowing that existing functionalities are not compromised.

	Documentation: Tests serve as living documentation, showcasing how different parts of your code are expected to behave.

# How to write Docstrings to create tests?
	Docstrings are a form of inline documentation that can be used to create tests. By incorporating testing information within your docstrings, you can generate documentation and tests simultaneously. Use a consistent format to describe input parameters, expected output, and any special conditions.

		Example of a docstring with testing information:

		pyCode
			def add_numbers(a, b):
   		"""
   		 Adds two numbers.

    		Parameters:
      			- a (int): The first number.
    			- b (int): The second number.

    		Returns:
    			int: The sum of a and b.

    		Example:
    		>>> add_numbers(2, 3)
    		5
    		"""
		return a + b

# How to write documentation for each module and function?
	Documenting your code is essential for understanding its purpose, functionality, and usage. Follow these guidelines for documenting modules and functions:

		Module Documentation:
		Provide a brief overview of the module's purpose.
		List any dependencies.
		Include usage examples if applicable.

		python
		Copy code
		"""
		Module Name

		Brief description of the module.
		"""
		Function Documentation:
		Describe the function's purpose and usage.
		Document parameters and return values.
		Include any exceptions the function may raise.

		python
		Copy code
		def example_function(param1, param2):
  		"""
		    Brief description of the function.

		    Parameters:
			    - param1 (type): Description of param1.
			    - param2 (type): Description of param2.

		    Returns:
		    type: Description of the return value.

		    Raises:
		    - SomeException: Description of when this exception is raised.
      		"""
    		
      		
		# Function implementation

# What are the basic option flags to create tests?
	When creating tests, it's essential to use various options and flags to customize test runs. Some basic options include:

		-v, --verbose: Increase verbosity to get more detailed output.
		-k expression: Only run tests that match the provided expressions.
		-m marker: Run tests with specific markers.
		--cov: Measure code coverage during test execution.
		--pdb: Enter the debugger on test failure.
		
  	Example usage:

		bash
		Copy code
		pytest -v -k test_module
		Explore the documentation of your testing framework for additional flags and options.

# How to find edge cases?
	Identifying and testing edge cases is crucial to ensure your software behaves correctly in extreme or boundary conditions. Consider the following strategies:

		Boundary Analysis: Identify the boundaries of input ranges and test values at those boundaries.
		Equivalence Partitioning: Group inputs into equivalent classes and test representative values from each class.
		Error Guessing: Anticipate potential error scenarios and test for them.
		Random Testing: Generate random inputs to explore a wide range of possibilities.
		Regularly review and update your tests to incorporate new edge cases as your codebase evolves.

	By following these practices, you can build a robust testing and documentation strategy that contributes to the overall success and maintainability of your project.
