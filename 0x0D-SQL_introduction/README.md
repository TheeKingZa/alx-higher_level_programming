# What's a database?

A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of that data.

# What's a relational database?

A relational database is a type of database that uses a tabular structure to organize data into tables with rows and columns. It relies on a system of relationships between tables to store and manage data.

# What does SQL stand for?

SQL stands for "Structured Query Language." It is a domain-specific language used for managing and querying relational databases.

# What's MySQL?

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL. It is widely used for data storage, retrieval, and management.

# How to create a database in MySQL:

You can create a database in MySQL using the SQL command: CREATE DATABASE database_name;. For example, to create a database named "mydb," you can use CREATE DATABASE mydb;.

# What does DDL and DML stand for?
  * DDL stands for "Data Definition Language." It includes SQL commands for defining and managing the structure of a database, such as creating tables, altering tables, and defining constraints.
  * DML stands for "Data Manipulation Language." It includes SQL commands for manipulating data within a database, such as inserting, updating, and deleting data.

# How to CREATE or ALTER a table:
  * To create a table, you can use the SQL command: CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype, column2 datatype, ...);.
  To alter a table, you can use the SQL command: ALTER TABLE table_name ...; followed by the specific alteration you want to make.

# How to SELECT data from a table:
  * You can retrieve data from a table using the SQL command: SELECT columns FROM table WHERE conditions;. This retrieves specific columns from the table based on specified conditions.

# How to INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE data:
  *To insert data, use the SQL command: INSERT INTO table (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);.
  *  To update data, use the SQL command: UPDATE table SET column1 = new_value WHERE conditions;.
  *  To delete data, use the SQL command: DELETE FROM table WHERE conditions;.

# what are subqueries:
  * Subqueries, also known as nested queries, are queries embedded within another SQL query. They allow you to retrieve data based on the results of another query, making complex queries and data manipulations possible.

# How to use MySQL functions:
  * MySQL provides various built-in functions for performing operations on data, such as mathematical calculations, string manipulation, date and time functions, and more. You can use these functions in your SQL queries to process and retrieve data efficiently.
