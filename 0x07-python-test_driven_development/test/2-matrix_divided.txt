Test Case "2-matrix_divided": Dividing a Matrix by a Number
Description:
    This test case verifies that the matrix_divided function correctly divides all elements of a matrix by a given number and returns the expected result.

Steps:
1. Prepare a matrix, for example:
   matrix = [
       [1, 2, 3],
       [4, 5, 6]
   ]
   and set div = 3.

2. Check the validity of the input:
   - Verify that the matrix is a list of lists containing integers or floats.
   - Ensure that each row of the matrix has the same size.
   - Verify that div is a number and not equal to zero.

3. Proceed to divide each element of the matrix by div:
   - 1 / 3 = 0.33 (rounded to 2 decimal places)
   - 2 / 3 = 0.67 (rounded to 2 decimal places)
   - 3 / 3 = 1.0 (rounded to 2 decimal places)
   - 4 / 3 = 1.33 (rounded to 2 decimal places)
   - 5 / 3 = 1.67 (rounded to 2 decimal places)
   - 6 / 3 = 2.0 (rounded to 2 decimal places)

4. Create a new matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix but with elements updated to the rounded results:
   result_matrix = [
       [0.33, 0.67, 1.0],
       [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]
   ]

5. Verify that the returned result from the matrix_divided function matches the expected result (result_matrix).

Expected Output:
[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]
