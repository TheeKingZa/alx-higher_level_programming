# Why Indentation is So Important in Python
    \n Indentation is a fundamental aspect of Python's syntax. It's used to define code blocks, like loops and functions. Unlike many other programming languages that use braces, Python uses consistent indentation to represent code structure. Proper indentation ensures readability and helps avoid errors.
      pyCode
      # example

         if condition:
         # This code is indented correctly
         do_something()
         else:
         # This is another indented block
         do_something_else()

# How to Use Statements
      Conditional statements allow you to execute code based on certain conditions.
         pyCode
            if [condition]:
            # Code to execute if condition is True
            else:
            # Code to execute if condition is False


# How to Use Comments
      Comments are essential for explaining your code and making it more understandable.
         pyCode
         
         # This is a single-line comment
         
         """
         This is a multi-line comment.
         You can write multiple lines here.
         """
         
# How to Assign Values to Variables
      Variables store data that can be used throughout your program.
      pyCode
      
      variable_name = value

# How to Use while and for Loops
      Loops allow you to repeat code blocks multiple times.
         pyCode
         
            # while loop
            while [condition]:
            # Code to repeat while condition is True

            # for loop
            for item in iterable:
            # Code to execute for each item in the iterable

# How Python’s for Differs from C’s
      Python's for loop is more like a "for each" loop.
      It iterates over elements in an iterable, like a list, without the need for explicit control variables
      and loop conditions as in C.

# How to Use break and continue Statements.
      * break: Exits the loop immediately.
      * continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.
      
         pyCode
         
            while condition:
               if something:
               break  # Exit the loop
               
            if something_else:
            continue  # Skip to the next iteration


# How to Use else Clauses on Loops.
      Python loops can have an else block that executes when the loop completes without encountering a 'break' statement.

# What Does the pass Statement Do, and When to Use It
      The pass statement is a placeholder for code that you plan to implement later.
      It does nothing when executed.
         pyCode
            if condition:
            pass  # Will do something later
            else:
            # Actual code here

# How to Use range
range() generates a sequence of numbers that can be used in loops.
---------
pyCode
----
for i in range(5):  # Generates 0 to 4
    print(i)
---------

What is a Function and How Do You Use Functions
A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.
-----
pyCode
----
def function_name(parameters):
    # Code to execute
    return something  # Optional return value

----------------
What Does a Function Return Without a Return Statement
A function without a return statement implicitly returns None.

Scope of Variables
The scope of a variable defines where it can be accessed. Variables can have local or global scope.

What's a Traceback
A traceback is an error message that Python displays when an exception occurs. It helps you identify the source of the error in your code.

# Arithmetic Operators and How to Use Them
      Python supports common arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, // (floor division), % (modulus), ** (exponentiation).
            pyCode
            result = 10 + 5
